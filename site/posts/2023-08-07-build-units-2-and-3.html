These would be Units 2 &amp; 3, with Unit 1 having been completed in 1987. However, the application was subsequently withdrawn due to the fact that the demand for electricity in the area wasnâ€™t expected to grow enough to need all of that additional supply. But that was then, this is now.</p><p>Here are five reasons why Units 2 and 3 should be built:</p><h2 id="1.-clean-and-low-carbon-energy-source">1. Clean and Low-Carbon Energy Source</h2><p>Nuclear power is a cornerstone of clean energy generation. It produces virtually no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making it a vital tool in the fight against climate change. With the world facing the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, expanding the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant would contribute significantly to meeting regional and national emission reduction goals. By avoiding the release of millions of tons of CO2 annually, Units 2 and 3 would be instrumental in mitigating the environmental impacts of traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.</p><h2 id="2.-reliability-and-baseload-power">2. Reliability and Baseload Power</h2><p>One of the most notable advantages of nuclear power is its ability to provide baseload power, which ensures a stable and consistent electricity supply. Unlike intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind, nuclear reactors operate continuously, without being affected by weather conditions or time of day. This reliability is crucial for maintaining a steady power supply, especially during peak demand periods or emergencies. By adding Units 2 and 3 to the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, the region would enhance its energy security and reduce its dependence on less reliable energy sources.</p><h2 id="3.-job-creation-and-economic-benefits">3. Job Creation and Economic Benefits</h2><p>The construction and operation of new nuclear units at Shearon Harris would provide a significant economic boost to the local community and the wider region. The expansion project would create thousands of well-paying jobs in various sectors, from engineering and construction to operations and maintenance. Additionally, the increased economic activity generated by the expansion would stimulate growth in ancillary industries, leading to enhanced prosperity for the area.</p><h2 id="4.-technological-advancements-and-safety">4. Technological Advancements and Safety</h2><p>Advancements in nuclear technology have led to safer and more efficient reactor designs. Newer reactors incorporate passive safety features that greatly reduce the risk of accidents and eliminate the need for human intervention in certain scenarios. The rigorous safety standards and regulations that govern nuclear power plant construction and operation ensure that any expansion at Shearon Harris would adhere to the highest levels of safety. By embracing these advancements, the plant can further solidify its reputation as a responsible and secure energy provider.</p><h2 id="5.-long-term-energy-planning">5. Long-Term Energy Planning</h2><p>Energy systems require long-term planning to ensure a stable and sustainable supply for the future. The expansion of the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant aligns with prudent energy planning by providing a reliable and predictable source of power for decades to come. As renewable energy technologies continue to evolve, nuclear power will remain a constant and consistent foundation for the energy mix, supporting the integration of intermittent renewables and helping to achieve a balanced and resilient grid.</p><p>The imperative to build Units 2 and 3 at the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant is clear and compelling. From its role in combating climate change and reducing carbon emissions to its provision of reliable baseload power and economic benefits, nuclear energy offers a host of advantages that align with the goals of a sustainable and prosperous future. By embracing this expansion, we can take a significant step toward ensuring a clean, secure, and thriving energy landscape for generations to come.</p><p>Want to learn more? <a href="https://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2022/05/13/at-35-harris-nuclear-plant-continues-to-grow-along-with-the-community">Here is a great summary of the life of the plant</a></p>
