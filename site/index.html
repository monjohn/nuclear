As a state with a growing population, expanding industries, and a commitment to reducing carbon emissions, the demand for reliable and clean energy sources has never been greater. Nuclear power offers a compelling solution by providing a consistent and low-carbon energy supply that can meet the state’s electricity needs while contributing significantly to its emission reduction goals. Furthermore, as North Carolina continues to explore avenues for economic growth, the construction of additional nuclear units would stimulate job creation, boost local economies, and enhance energy security. Embracing nuclear power aligns with the state’s forward-looking energy policies, ensuring a sustainable energy future that balances environmental stewardship, economic prosperity, and long-term energy resilience.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p><a href="https://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2020/03/02/the-dawn-of-the-atomic-age-in-the-carolinas">The early history of nuclear power in NC</a></p>
